                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.</p>
                <p>It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages.</p>
                <p>CSS allows developers to separate content from design, making websites easier to maintain and update.</p>
                <p>There are three types of CSS: inline, internal, and external, each with different use cases depending on the project's needs.</p>
                <p>Selectors in CSS are used to target HTML elements, and rules are applied to define their style.</p>
                <p>CSS properties include settings for margins, padding, borders, text alignment, background images, and more.</p>
                <p>Responsive design is achieved with CSS using media queries, ensuring websites look good on all screen sizes.</p>
                <p>Modern CSS includes features like Flexbox and Grid Layout, which provide advanced control over page structure and alignment.</p>
                <p>CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS add functionality like variables, nesting, and mixins to improve workflow.</p>
                <p>Animations and transitions in CSS enhance user interaction without needing JavaScript for simple effects.</p>
                <p>Frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS offer pre-defined styles and components to speed up development.</p>
                <p>Understanding CSS specificity and the cascade is essential for managing how styles are applied and overridden.</p>
